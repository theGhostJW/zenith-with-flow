# Zenith With Flow

This project is a successor to [zenith-test-complete](https://github.com/theGhostJW/zenith-test-complete). The undelying concepts similar to [zenith-test-complete](https://github.com/theGhostJW/zenith-test-complete) but TestComplete web UI intractiopn was replaced with Selenium and productivity was improved with ES6 and Flow.

This is more or less finished but circumstances have changed since completion and future development effort is being dedicated to [pyrethrum](https://github.com/theGhostJW/pyrethrum) which takes these concepts further and has the benefits of a pure functional language.

As such this project is no longer maintained.
