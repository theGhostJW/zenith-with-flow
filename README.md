# Zenith with Flow

This project is a successor to zenith-test-complete. The underlying concepts similar to zenith-test-complete but TestComplete web UI interaction was replaced with Selenium and productivity was improved with ES6 and Flow.

This is more or less finished but circumstances have changed since completion and future development effort is being dedicated to pyrethrum which takes these concepts further and has the benefits of a pure functional language.

As such this project is no longer maintained.
